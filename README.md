The most important part of articles and posts floating all over the internet, majorly the social media, is their immense influence on the masses. 
Hence, it is highly important for such posts and articles to be unbiased so that they serve as a means for people to get aware of the facts and form opinions of their own, 
free of any influence. Hence, it is our attempt to build an automated tool that can score posts and articles on basis of their objectivity and inform readers beforehand as 
to how biased it is. This can further serve as a benchmark for ensuring fair and factual journalism as well as ascertaining people are not influenced by reading stuff online 
and can form opinions genuinely of their own.
